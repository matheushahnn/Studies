# TDD

## THREE LAWS OF TDD
1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a falling unit test pass;
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test then is sufficient to faill, and compilation failures are failures;
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
